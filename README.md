You are to write a program to emulate a print queue. The program will read commands from a file named “pg3cmds.txt” along the lines of
1:14 PRINT 5
This means that at 1:14 a print job is being sent to the queue that will take 5 minutes to complete. You may assume that the file will contain the commands in the correct format. [h]h:mm
